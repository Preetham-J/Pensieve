# Pensieve
This is a simple to-do list web application that allows you to manage all of your tasks. You can add tasks to your list, view them, and 
mark them as completed. When you're done with them, you can delete the completed tasks or delete your entire list all together.

## Development
I created this application to further explore web application development, particularly on the backend. To create this application, I used
Python with Django and SQLite for the back-end, along with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end. The knowledge I gained from this 
project will definitely come in handy for my future projects!
