# Pensieve
## What is it?
Tired of forgetting what you need to do everyday? With a bit of magic, this Pensieve can save you! This is a simple to-do list web application that allows you to manage all of your tasks. You can add tasks to your list, view them, and mark them as completed. When you're done with them, you can delete the completed tasks or delete your entire list all together.

## Development Tools
I created this application to further explore web application development, particularly on the backend. To create this application, I used
Python with Django and SQLite for the back-end, along with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end. 

## What I Learned
Overall, I was able to learn a lot about how web applications are developed. Django allowed me to combine my knowledge of front-end (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) and databasing (SQL) to create a meaningful application. In particular, I was able to learn about the Model-View-Controller design pattern, HTTP request methods, and creating responsive and live pages that communicate closely with a database. The things I learned in this application will definitely come in handy for future projects!
